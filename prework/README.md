OBJECT OF THE GAME
Player attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21.

GAME RULES:
Face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand.
The player starts with two cards, one of the computer's cards is hidden until the end.
To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stay' is to hold your total and end your turn.
If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.
If you are dealt 21 from the start (Ace & 10), you got a "21!".
